#### Home assignments

1. Join the datacamp group [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/81d77a56b3ac69eab65d71bba6e31c29a86a51f2bcb82b091e31e2b187655aa4) using @edu.hse.ru email adress.

2. Complete the courses 

[Forecasting using R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/forecasting-using-r)

[Arima models in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/arima-models-in-r)

Deadline: exam date, 21:00 MSK.

Note: the forecasting field is rapidly evolving and these two courses use old syntax. 
The code will work but some things may be done simplier :)

If you think that these two courses are useless for you then just write me a letter and propose any two other datacamp time series courses as a replacement. Probably I will accept your proposal.
