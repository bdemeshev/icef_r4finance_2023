#### Home assignments

1. Register on [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

2. Fill in the [form](....). 

3. Complete the courses 

[Forecasting using R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/forecasting-using-r)

[Arima models in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/arima-models-in-r)

Deadline: exam date, 21:00 MSK.

Note: the forecasting field is rapidly evolving and these two courses use old syntax. 
The code will work but some things may be done simplier :)

If you think that these two courses are useless for you then just write me a letter and propose any two other datacamp time series courses as a replacement. Probably I will accept your proposal.
